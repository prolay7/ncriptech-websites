                        <div class="text">Education is the fundamental force for the complete development of children. For the complete development of a child to help him become a complete human being, we should inculcate moral, cultural and spiritual values in our students along with cognitive development. These are possible if we are able to manifest the potentialities already inherent in child. Educational institutions are the laboratories wherein all these efforts are inculcated. Teachers should play as a ‘friend, philosopher and guide’ for shaping vision of academic and attitudinal success for all students. Teachers’ Training institutions act as the living agency to make trainees (student teachers) to be more competent in the teaching learning process.</div>
