                                    <h3>Principle's Message</h3>
                                        <p>School education lays the foundation for the future of the student and ensures a stable, successful
and satisfied life. The Gyanjyoti Public School is well aware of the importance and significance
of different stages of student’s life and keeping in mind all these, we adhere to the latest NEP –
2020, therefore the activities of the school are planned to identify and nurture their inherent
talents. The school puts equal emphasis on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy for all our young
learners. The period from birth to eight years old is one of remarkable brain development for
children and represents a crucial window for opportunity for education. We believe Early
Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) is truly inclusive that is much more than just preparation
for primary school. <br>Teaching and learning process is mainly child centered and targets to prepare
every individual for their career and to acquire adequate life skills. The school activities are
planned and prepared meticulously, giving equal importance to academics, co-curricular and
extra-curricular activities. These activities are strategically implemented to ensure the overall
development of the student. </p>

                                       
                                       
                                    </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="col-lg-12 manage">

                            <p>The school is well equipped with the state of the art facilities and an
excellent infrastructure which provides an ideal and safe environment for teaching and learning.
Experiential Learning, Creative Learning and Hands-on activity are some of our methods and
approaches to foster the teaching learning process to make our learners competent and proficient
in all aspects of life. I feel proud to express that the school is expected to perform extremely well in
all the aspects to ensure academic and human excellence. <br>
I strongly believe that the true
education should instill knowledge, creativity, tradition and culture among the children. The
purpose of education is not just to produce academics but also to develop humane and sensitive
citizens. The clear vision of the management, the systematic approach and implementation of the
activities by the administration, commitment and dedication of the teaching and non-teaching staff,
cooperation of parents and the hard work of the students, together will ensure to brand the
Gyanjyoti Public School as a center of academic excellence. Gyanjyoti means enlightenment of
knowledge. Our journey towards excellence continues by enlightening the vast world of
knowledge. With best regards, I hope, with our collective endeavor, we shall reach our goal with
unique and universal possibilities in the forthcoming days.</p>
